- [Mongo DB docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/)
- [Mongo Express docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo-express/)

### Installing ‚è¨

Please carefully follow the below step to have the application up and running.

After downloading and installing docker client on your environment (computer), browse to the docker registry [(docker hub)](https://www.docker.com) and download the [Mongo DB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) and [Mongo Express images](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo-express/).

<i>Note: Your downloaded docker images will automatically appear under the images in your docker client.</i>

Copy and paste the below code as is and paste it in your favourable code editor (Notepad++/VScode) or any other.

   <code>
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    container_name: mongo_db
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    volumes:
      - mongo:/data
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=whiz
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=isaacwhiz
  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express
    container_name: mongo_express
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
    environment:
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=isaac
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=isaacwhiz
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb
volumes:
  mongo: {}
   </code>

Please follow the same identation as this is a `.yml` file

Save the above file as `docker-compose` with a `.yml` or `.yaml` file extention.

Use the terminal (command line interface), browse to the location where you stored the file and type `docker-compose up`. This command starts the `mongo_db` and `mongo_express` running on port `27017` and `8081` respectively.

Then open the browser and enter `http://localhost:8081` then on the dashboard click `add database` button and add `chat_app` database.

Open a new tab and type `http://localhost:8088` and voila, you have successfully configured and run the chat app. Next steps include logging in and starting to chat.
